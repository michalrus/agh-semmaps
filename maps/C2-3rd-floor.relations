# relations but YAGNIâ€¦ a not working draft

# refining the default `has' (transitive) a.k.a. `is-inside-of-on-the-map':

relation L lies-on R
  L being []
  R being [kind=room].[kind=desk]
  R has L
  transitive

relation L near R
  W being [kind=room]
  L being W.[]
  R being W.[]
  distance(L,R) < 0.10*W.size
  symmetric
